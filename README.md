# This Was My 4th Company Paid Project 💼✨

In this project, I developed an online teaching platform designed to connect educators with students efficiently. The platform allows teachers to create and manage their courses, schedule classes, and engage with students through interactive features. 🚀

### Key Features:
- **User Account Management:** Teachers and students can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Course Creation:** Educators can design courses, upload materials, and set pricing.
- **Live Class Scheduling:** Integrated calendar for scheduling live classes with students.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Chat functionality to enable instant messaging between teachers and students.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment processing for course enrollments.

### Technologies Used:
- **PHP:** For server-side development and dynamic content management.
- **AJAX:** To enhance user experience with seamless interactions without page reloads.

This project not only honed my technical skills but also helped me understand the importance of user experience in educational environments. I'm excited about the positive impact this platform will have on learners and educators alike! 📚❤️
